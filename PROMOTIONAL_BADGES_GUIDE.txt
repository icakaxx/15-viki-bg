PROMOTIONAL BADGES MANAGEMENT GUIDE
====================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This guide explains how to add and manage promotional badges on AC product cards in the /buy page.
Promotional badges include: NEW, BESTSELLER, and FEATURED.

BADGE TYPES
-----------
1. NEW - Green badge for new products
2. BESTSELLER - Orange badge for popular products  
3. FEATURED - Blue badge for featured/highlighted products

HOW TO ADD BADGES TO PRODUCTS
-----------------------------

STEP 1: Find Product ID
- Go to the /buy page in your browser
- Open Developer Tools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Type: document.querySelectorAll('[data-product-id]') or check the product cards
- Note the ProductID number (e.g., 108, 107, 106)

STEP 2: Edit Configuration File
- Open: src/lib/promotionalFlags.js
- Find the arrays at the top of the file:
  * newProducts: [108, 107, 106]     // Products with "NEW" badge
  * bestsellerProducts: [108, 105, 104]  // Products with "BESTSELLER" badge
  * featuredProducts: [106, 105, 103]    // Products with "FEATURED" badge

STEP 3: Add Product IDs
- Add the ProductID to the appropriate array(s)
- A product can have multiple badges (add to multiple arrays)
- Example: To make product 109 show "NEW" badge:
  newProducts: [108, 107, 106, 109]

STEP 4: Save and Refresh
- Save the promotionalFlags.js file
- Refresh the /buy page in your browser
- The badges should appear immediately

EXAMPLES
--------

Single Badge:
- Product 110 shows only "NEW" badge:
  newProducts: [108, 107, 106, 110]

Multiple Badges:
- Product 108 shows both "NEW" and "BESTSELLER" badges:
  newProducts: [108, 107, 106]
  bestsellerProducts: [108, 105, 104]

All Badges:
- Product 111 shows all three badges:
  newProducts: [108, 107, 106, 111]
  bestsellerProducts: [108, 105, 104, 111]
  featuredProducts: [106, 105, 103, 111]

REMOVE BADGES
-------------
- Remove the ProductID from the array(s)
- Save the file and refresh the page
- The badge(s) will disappear immediately

FILE LOCATION

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
1. Badges not appearing:
   - Check that ProductID is correct
   - Verify the ID is added to the right array
   - Refresh the page completely (Ctrl+F5)

2. Multiple badges not showing:
   - Ensure ProductID is in multiple arrays
   - Check for typos in the arrays

3. Badges in wrong position:
   - Check CSS file: src/styles/Page Styles/Products.module.css
   - Look for .promotionalBadges and .badge classes

ADVANCED USAGE
--------------
