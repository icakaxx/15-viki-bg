 Priority: High
Apply the following updates and visual improvements across the frontend of the application:

📱 1. Mobile View – Cart Visibility
Issue: On mobile devices, the cart is not visible or accessible. - done 

Fix: Ensure the cart icon or navigation is visible and functional in mobile view.

Expectation: A user should be able to view and access the cart from any screen size, especially phones.

🖱️ 2. Back to Top Button – Hand Cursor
Update: Add a pointer (hand) cursor when hovering over the “Back to Top” button to indicate it's clickable. 

Functionality stays the same — only cursor feedback changes. - done

🌐 3. i18n Translation – 'Loading' on Buy ACs
Issue: On the Buy AC page (when language is set to Bulgarian), the word “Loading” still appears in English.

Fix:

Replace with the correct localized string: Зареждане. - should be fixed

✅ Also audit the application for other similar untranslated words and list them before proceeding with code — ask me to confirm.

Look specifically in:

API fetch states

Button spinners/loaders

Dynamic content fallback values

💰 4. Price Range Display – Buy AC Page
Issue: The UI currently shows:
{{min}} лв. и {{max}} лв.
without actual values.

Action: Ask me for the min and max values to use (or fetch dynamically if already implemented).

Then: Populate the placeholders correctly or gracefully hide the component if values aren’t available. - done

🎯 5. Filter Bar Spacing – Buy AC Page
Issue: The “Filters” title and “Clear All” link are too close together.

Fix: Add appropriate horizontal spacing or padding between the two for mobile and desktop view.

📐 6. Product Form – Separate Dimensions
Issue: In the admin panel’s Add Product form, the size/dimensions field is unclear.

Fix:

Split size inputs into:

Indoor Unit Dimensions (e.g., Width x Height x Depth)

Outdoor Unit Dimensions

Add placeholder text to help admins input correctly.

🏷️ 7. Promotional Tags – Checkbox Alignment
Issue: In the “Promotional Labels” section (e.g. “Most Sold”, “New Product”), the checkboxes are not vertically aligned with their labels.

Fix: Align the checkboxes so they sit inline with the text on all screen sizes.

Use flexbox or grid layout where necessary for proper alignment.
