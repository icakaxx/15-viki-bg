Update the visual style of this component to follow a more modern design (spacings, fonts, colors, layout), but do not touch or remove any functionality, logic, hooks, event handlers, routing (e.g., Link, router.push), or state.

❗ Focus only on changing:
- CSS class names and Tailwind styles (or regular styles)
- HTML structure (non-functional changes like wrapper divs)
- Visual layout improvements (like spacing, alignment, responsive behavior)

Leave all:
- `onClick`, `href`, `Link`, `useEffect`, `useState`, etc. untouched
- Component structure, props, and logic **unchanged**



If Cursor still accidentally removes a line of logic, just say:

Undo the logic removal from the last step — restore all functional behavior and only apply the visual updates.
